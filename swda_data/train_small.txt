A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|So, What kind of experience do you, do you have, then with child care?|qw
B|I guess, I think, uh, I wonder if that worked.|qy^d
A|Does it say something?|qy
B|I think it usually does.|sd
B|You might try, uh,|ad
B|I don't know,|h
B|hold it down a little longer,|ad
B|and see if it, uh,|ad
A|Okay|aa
A|Well, Does it usually make a recording or|qy
B|Okay|b
B|I, Well, I don't remember.|sd
B|It seemed like it did,|sd
B|but it might not.|sd
B|I guess I guess we can start. Uh,|sv
A|Okay.|bk
A|Okay.|aa
B|No,|nn
B|I don't, I don't have any kids.|sd
B|I, uh, my sister has a, she just had a baby,|sd
B|he's about five months old|sd
B|and she was worrying about going back to work and what she was going to do with him and the different,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|do you have kids?|qy
A|I have three.|na
B|Oh, really?|bh
A|Uh-huh.|ny
A|Yeah,|b
A|I do|sd
A|Yes, uh,|%
A|I don't work, though,|sd
A|but I used to work and, when I had two children.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit,|sd
A|but I don't envy anybody who's in that situation to find day care.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But, does your sister live in a big community?|qy
B|Uh, yeah|ny
B|she lives,|sd
B|it's a, it's a fairly large community.|sd
B|She, uh, got real lucky, though.|sd
B|He had a boss who, uh, moved into a larger office|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and she's able to take her baby to work with her.|sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|And it's a small office that she works in|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and, uh, it's a, it's a legal firm, office,|sd
B|and it's just one lawyer|sd
A|Um.|%
B|and so she's the only one really that takes care of the office.|sd
B|There's no one else that works there.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|And so they have an extra room and everything for the baby,|sd
B|so it works out pretty good for her.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
A|How lucky|ba
A|I, I know a lot of people around here sometimes have, like, mothers or grandmothers that take care of their kids|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|and, but, the community I'm in is not a real large one,|sd
A|so there are a lot of people who babysit in their homes that, you know,|sd
A|you either know them or know somebody who knows them to get to,|sd
B|Yeah,|b
B|so it's fairly safe.|bf
A|Yeah,|aa
A|to get references and that,|sd
A|so, but, uh,|%
A|I, I don't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center, but, simply because there's so many kids and so many|sd
B|Worried that they're not going to get enough attention?|qy
A|Yeah,|ny
A|and, uh, you know, colds and things like that get spread real easy and things,|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|but, and they're expensive|sv
A|and, course, there's a lot of different types of day care available, too, you know, where they teach them academic things.|sd
B|Yes.|aa
A|Or they just watch them and let them play and things like that,|sd
A|but,|%
A|take a long time to find the right place|sv
B|Yeah,|aa
B|and you, and you don't always even know if it's, it's going to be the right place or not.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Anything, I guess, could happen.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Because after, I guess after he, you know, gets to a certain age she's going to have to take him to a day care.|qy^d
A|Uh-huh,|ny
A|when he starts toddling around and stuff.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Yeah.|b^m
B|When, when he's not, when she can't keep control of him|sd
B|and he starts crawling|sd
B|that's,|%
A|Uh-huh.|aa
A|It would be hard,|sv
A|I think it would be kind of stressful.|sv
A|It would be nice to have him around|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|but, uh, seems like, you know,|sv
A|what if he cried at the wrong time|qh
A|or the phone rang or, you know, at the wrong time|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
B|Yeah.|b
A|But,|%
B|I think she has problems with that, too.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Well, when you have kids, will you work?|qy
A|Do you work now?|qy
B|I don't know|no
B|that's something I've considered. Uh,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I always kind of think it would be neat to be able to watch them and be there for them all the time.|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Is that what you do?|qy
A|Uh, yeah.|ny
A|Actually, I teach my kids at home,|sd
A|so I'm here all the time.|sd
B|Oh, so they don't go to school.|bf
B|Is it like, uh,|qy
B|oh, what's that called,|t1
B|it's, uh, correspondence school,|sd
B|they do it at home.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
A|Yeah,|b
A|yeah.|b
B|That's interesting.|sv
A|So,|%
B|Do you have to have any special training?|qy
A|Not,|%
A|it depends on the state you live actually.|sd
A|Some laws absolutely prohibit it.|sd
A|Some states, uh, say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that.|sd
A|Our state doesn't yet, say that|sd
A|and I'm not a certified teacher.|sd
A|I went to college,|sd
A|but I, you know, but my kids are only elementary grades, levels right now|sd
A|and so,|%
B|So they haven't been to public schools at all.|bf
A|One of them was for a couple of years|no
A|and so, you know, my oldest, he was,|sd
A|and then my youngest two have never been.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|So anyway,|%
A|but we don't,|%
B|So, you've never had,|%
A|Well, uh, does the company you work for test for drugs?|qy
B|Actually, uh, they just recently started a policy of testing drugs, which was kind of interesting,|na
B|because when I went to work for them, uh, they didn't do that,|sd
B|but, uh, since then they've, they've started a drug testing policy, not because of their own, uh, convictions, but because the clients of our company are requests that we do that.|sd
A|Huh.|%
B|How about you?|qo
A|Uh, no,|nn
A|we're not being tested for drugs at all, uh,|sd
A|our policies and procedures manual, uh, the furthest it goes about drugs is in the, kind of the miscellaneous section, or it's reasons for immediate dismissal,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|it says, use of narcotics on company premises.|sd
B|Um.|%
A|So that's pretty general,|sv
A|but, uh, I work for an environmental management firm|sd
B|Okay.|b
A|and I'm an engineer there,|sd
A|but I do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites,|sd
A|but I don't operate any machinery.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|Now, people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that are under a, a medical monitoring program,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|because they're at a higher risk of exposure|sd
A|and blood screening is part of that|sd
A|and I, I think that drugs,|sd
A|they do test for drugs in that capacity,|sd
A|but it's not their exclusive,|sd
A|it's just part, it's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
A|But I think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field.|sv
A|What is the nature of your company's business?|qw
B|Well, it's actually, uh,|^h
B|we do oil well services.|sd
B|So, a lot of our clients are oil companies, big oil companies,|sd
B|and they go out to,|sd
B|we have engineers who, uh, go out to the oil well, to the, to the client's oil well, and, and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff,|sd
B|so the clients are very concerned that, you know, the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy, because they're on their, their, you know, territory and everything,|sd
B|but the thing that's interesting is that I I'm an engineer and, a software engineer|sv
A|Um.|%
B|and I work in the software, uh, house,|sd
B|and everybody there, you know, are all software engineers.|sd
B|They've never, you know, they never go out to the, the oil rigs or anything,|sd
B|and yet, we're getting, we're subjected to this policy, you know, the same one that, uh, all the engineers have to, to,|sd
B|well, a little different, actually,|h
B|but, uh, you know, we have to go through the same thing,|sd
B|and it's, but it's, uh, it's a little different, I guess than than a lot of drug policies.|sv
B|In our case, it's like, when you hire on, they'll test you,|sd
B|and then if you get injured on the job, if you like trip and fall or something, uh, they give you a drug test right away.|sd
A|Oh, really?|bh
B|Other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that,|sd
B|but, a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first.|sd
B|Particularly, like uh, we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol,|sd
B|and they didn't find any problem with that, you know,|sd
B|but,|%
A|Right.|aa
B|Uh,|%
A|We, that's been an, a, an issue, uh, in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening.|sd
A|they'll have these little parties,|sd
A|and people will just get,|sd
A|I mean, I've,|%
A|my brother lives where I work,|sd
A|and I have many a time called him to come get me, you know.|sd
A|And, uh, uh, but, you know, they don't think twice about serving beer by the keg. You know,|sd
B|Yeah|b
A|but, uh, I think drug testing,|sv
A|and I, I don't know,|h
A|I guess I I think it's got some relevance,|sv
A|but I think its relevance is pretty limited.|sv
A|I mean, I think, you know,|sv
A|in your case, I don't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|I think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|it's really, it's really bizarre.|sv
B|Uh, particularly, like where we are, you know.|sd
B|I, I,|%
B|there was a story of a woman last year who, who actually did slip on the ice and, and like sprained her ankle|sd
B|and she, she was a personnel secretary|sd
B|and she had to get tested|sd
B|and, I don't know|h
B|I'm ambivalent about the whole thing.|sd
B|I, you know, I have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand, it's like if, you know,|sd
B|they're, they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense|sv
B|and, you know, it's like you're, I mean, employments are contractual by nature anyway|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|but, uh, I had an experience when I was interviewing for a job that, where I had to, uh, uh, do a drug test|sd
B|and, and it's, it was kind of a long story,|sd
B|but it was, it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through,|sv
B|and it amounted to, uh, going in, uh, before any of these interviews,|sd
B|I'm not even working for this company,|sd
B|I'm going in for, like, interviews|sd
B|and they flew me out to Chicago|sd
B|and, and, uh, before I went into any of the interviews, uh, they took me to the doctor to give me a physical.|sd
B|They said it was going to be a physical, you know,|sd
B|and, uh, actually beforehand they told me they were going to, uh, do drug screening,|sd
B|but I had forgotten about that,|sd
B|and so, basically, I'd already peed off that morning|sd
B|and, and when I got in there, I didn't, I wasn't, like, able to give a full sample,|sd
B|and so they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes, drink a whole ton of water before I went to any of the interviews and go in there again,|sd
A|Oh.|b
A|Right.|b
B|and the, and the, the procedure is utterly humiliating.|sv
B|You go in there with the doctor,|sd
B|he makes you take off all your clothes|sd
B|and then he examines you.|sd
A|Uh, the question was kind of interesting to me because I was just trying to put together a, uh, long term financial plan and monthly budget.|sv
A|The only thing I do now is, uh, put the data into Quicken.|sd
A|I don't know if you are familiar with that.|qy^d
B|Yeah,|ny
B|I have some friends of mine who use Quicken|sd
B|and, uh, I've considered using it once myself,|sd
B|but I decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|So I, I kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken, at least for now.|sd
A|Um. I've found it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then, well, uh, uh, not bother to total it|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic.|sd
A|So it really helps with that.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, it's similar problems|sd
B|but, uh, we just have the one check book|sd
B|and we try to keep it up to date as much as possible|sd
B|and occasionally we will get behind like you say|sd
B|but, uh, it doesn't really seem to be too, too tight if we just remember to keep everything up, up to date and balanced.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Well, how to you handle that, the long range or medium range planning on finances?|qo
A|Well, actually we haven't had to. Uh, until just recently.|sd
A|I guess we've got a, a daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way|sd
A|so we needed to start doing more of that just for, uh, you know, saving for college and things like that.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|We tried a way, try to put away two and four thousand a year just for that.|sd
B|Yeah.|b
B|Well that's pretty good if you can do that.|sv
B|I know.|sd
B|I have a daughter who's ten|sd
B|and we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point|sd
B|but, uh, we're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall|sd
A|Um.|%
B|and then the money that I will be making this summer we'll be putting away for the college fund.|sd
A|Um. Sounds good.|ba
A|Yeah,|%
A|I guess we're, we're just at the point, uh,|sd
A|my wife worked until we had a family|sd
A|and then, you know, now we're just going on the one income|sd
A|so it's a lot more interesting trying to, uh,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to, uh, do it.|sv
A|You know, kind of enforce the savings.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|But, uh, it will be interesting to see|sv
B|Well our situation is just a little bit, kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently, uh, took on a full time job, well almost full time.|sd
A|Um.|%
B|So, it's only recently that we've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for, uh, long range goals like college and sickness and travel and that kind of thing.|sd
A|Um.|%
A|That sounds good.|ba
A|But, uh, uh, I was just curious, what, uh, part of the country.|qw
B|Oh, Stockton.|sd
A|Oh, okay.|bk
B|How about you?|qo
A|Uh, Cincinnati, actually.|sd
A|I was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with, uh, the western accents or something like that.|sd
A|I don't know how many people are, uh, getting involved in this|sd
A|but uh, well that's interesting.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I'm, uh, uh, actually, uh, I was kind of interested if you found out about the study by, uh, reading TELECOM DIGEST|qy^d
A|or was there another?|qrr
B|Uh, a colleague of mine at, uh, work got some information over, uh, the computer network called INTERNET.|sd
A|Oh, okay.|bk
A|Yeah,|b
A|that is how I got it as well|sd
A|but, uh,|%
B|And he just forwarded that on to me|sd
B|and, uh, it sounded like it would be an interesting project to participate in|sv
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|so I sent back mail.|sd
A|Yeah,|b
A|it will be interesting to see what, It would be interesting to see how the data base,|sv
A|so, well, I guess we're talking about the experiment.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|Uh, probably need to try to get back on the topic|sv
A|but, uh, it's hard to talk about finances without without getting to, uh, dollar figures I guess you know,|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|we could talk about some of the long range goals|oo_co_cc
A|and,|%
B|Well what other long range goals do you have besides college?|qo
A|Uh, well I think, either my wife or I would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|uh, I guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that.|sd
A|It seems like every year my employer just gives back, you know, a little bit your tuition reimbursement.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|I mean they use to reimburse one hundred percent|sd
A|and now it's, uh, now it's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class|sd
A|and, uh, it's a real shame from what we had before, uh, because we're,|sd
A|Right,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|uh, actually I lived over in Europe for a couple of years,|sd
A|I lived in Germany|sd
A|and in Germany they don't have the jury system.|sd
A|What they do is they have, uh, three judges, basically.|sd
A|And you get up there|sd
A|and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence|sd
A|and your defense attorney presents their evidence|sd
A|and those three guys take the evidence, go off, figure it out and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not.|sd
B|our judicial system is in such total chaos.|sv
B|I think what they need to do is, they need to somehow take the money out of it.|sv
B|I mean, when you have a man that's signed a, a, a statement saying he's guilty,|sd
B|we have a, a family called All day family.|sd
B|They were all murdered.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|All the people signed confessions,|sd
B|they went to a trial by jury.|sd
B|They been trying these people now for twenty-two years, ever since I was a child.|sd
A|Wow.|ba
B|And what they've done is they've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they've done,|sd
B|has nothing to do with justice whatsoever.|sv
A|Well, you know, it's, it's one of those things,|h
A|I mean, uh, uh, I would have to look at it.|sd
A|if they did it with the, uh, just the judges, the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight|sv
A|because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day, they know all the procedures,|sd
A|they know what's good and what isn't,|sd
A|they'd be able to say, I'm sorry,|sd
A|you can't use this as, uh, evidence, you know, because it was either illegally obtained or whatever|^q
A|and, you know, you wouldn't have this, uh, uh, theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the, to the jury|sd
A|and then the judge says, oh, no,|sd
A|disregard that.|^q
A|Come on,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|any jury's not going to disregard the evidence, you know|sv
B|Uh, that's true.|aa
B|I, I, I think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself.|sv
A|That may very well be.|sd
B|I, I hold it in the utmost contempt.|sd
A|Uh,|%
B|The, uh, my favorite is the police department,|sd
B|they're not aimed at the criminal.|sv
B|The judicial system is aimed at the citizens|sv
B|because you and I, we have work schedules,|sd
B|we can be called at work,|sd
B|we have Social Security numbers,|sd
B|they can trace us down,|sd
B|we have telephones,|sd
B|then we have checkbooks.|sd
B|Criminals have none of these things.|sv
B|They're real difficult to catch,|sv
B|and if they do catch them, they don't get any monetary gain out of it, whereas us, we write a check.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|So where do you think they target their efforts?|qh
A|That's true.|aa
B|They target their efforts toward the citizens not the criminals.|sv
A|Well, How would you go about changing it?|qo
B|You know, that's a,|%
B|I've nailed the problem down|sv
B|but I,|%
A|Leave the details up to somebody else, huh.|^2
B|Yeah,|aa
B|I'm going to have to leave those details like, what would you do about,|sd
B|I think, to begin with, you would you would have,|sv
B|like, here in Atlanta area, our crime rate is just astronomical,|sv
B|yet, you go out on the streets|sd
B|and they're giving speeding tickets.|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|I think somehow you have to separate the revenues from,|sv
A|Well, you know, uh, talking about the lawyers, you know what might very well do, uh, cause a, uh, a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that, is to set the fees for cases.|sv
A|It's kind of like do it, do it in the similar vein similar, like, uh, V C R or television repair.|sv
A|If you take your T V in, a lot of these T V repair places will say, well, I'll repair your T V for a hundred dollars,|sd
A|and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that's really tremendously wrong with it, then he eats it.|sd
A|He, he repairs it, gives it back to you, and takes your hundred dollars.|sd
A|Now, if he comes in and says, you know, I'll repair your, your V C R, or somebody else's V C R, for a hundred dollars, gets in there,|sd
A|maybe it's a blown fuse,|sd
A|takes him two minutes,|sd
A|he fixes it,|sd
A|he still charges you that hundred dollars.|sd
A|So, maybe if we did that with the lawyers, so that, you know, whether it's a murder case or a, you know, a civil, uh, somebody suing somebody else, you get X dollars for that case|sv
A|and that's it.|sd
B|Now, I firmly believe in that|aa
A|None of this,|%
B|because when you get the most heinous of crimes, have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney?|qy
A|Oh, yeah.|ny
B|And here's this bum that didn't have a job|sd
A|Yeah.|b
B|and he's got a attorney that you and I could never afford.|sd
A|That's true.|aa
B|Who's paying for that?|qh
A|Yeah.|b
A|Um, well, you, you know, you're talking to part of them that's paying for that|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|and you're talking to the other half that's paying for it|sv
A|That's right.|aa
A|You know that's, it, it's, it's amazing|sv
A|and, and when you stop and look at it, I mean, the judges, they're all former lawyers.|sv
B|Yeah,|b
B|well, that's another problem.|sv
B|I think to really correct the judicial system, you have to get the lawyers out of it|sv
B|I mean, they're, they're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever,|sv
B|and with that type person running it, I mean, you, you could expect that you,|sv
A|Do you know anyone that, uh, is, is in a nursing home or has ever been in one?|qy
B|No.|nn
B|But I, my grandparents were looking into it before|sd
B|so I know what they've said.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|Uh-huh.|b^m
A|Well, I'm trying to think.|^h
A|My, uh, uh, wife's grandmother had Alzheimer's|sd
A|and they were going to put her into a, a nursing home|sd
A|and, uh, they, when they put her in, she had all kinds of trouble|sd
A|and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a, a, you know, a, a nuisance.  Or worse than a nuisance,|sd
A|I mean  she sort of went, you know, bananas|sd
B|they thought it was too much of a bother.|bf
A|and they couldn't, couldn't deal with her|sd
A|So, I guess you need to, uh, know whether it's a, you know, a no deposit, no return kind of thing whether|sd
B|Right.|aa
B|If they're equipped too, to handle the kind of patients you're going to have you know, put in there too.|bf
A|Yeah.|aa
B|Because I know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|They wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her|sd
B|but they wanted to be independent as well. Have their own room.|sd
A|Right.|b
A|My grandmother actually was in a, a nursing home that, uh,|sd
A|there was a retirement hotel and then a, uh,|sd
A|there was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it|sd
A|so for, uh, the first few years she had her own apartment and, you know, made her own meals sometimes. But could, could also go and eat someplace else.|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|And then, uh, as she became less able to take care of herself, then she moved into this other part that was able to, uh, provide full-time care|sd
A|and, uh, she didn't have to do anything anymore.|sd
A|But my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly.|sv
A|And that's|%
A|I don't know whether that's because they, you know, sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the, the reason is.|sd
A|But I think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something.|sv
B|Well a lot of it's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
B|They need health care|sd
B|so they're already ill before they go.|sd
A|Right.|b
B|That's probably a  large factor.|sv
A|Yeah.|b
