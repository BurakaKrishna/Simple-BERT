B|Um, all right.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
A|I've, uh,|%
A|as far as I'm concerned, I find that the young women have lost so much because they have become more aggressive and more dominating,|sv
A|and I think that comes about from their being a definite factor in the job market now.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|aa
B|Oh, well, I tend, I tend to agree.|aa
B|Uh, in some ways I think it's, uh, I think if anything, a lot of, um, the changes that have occurred, uh,|sv
B|in some ways they're for the better|sv
B|because I think women should have a choice,|sv
B|and I do believe in the, being able to have a choice as to, as far as, what you would like to do with your life.|sv
B|But by the same token, and I know this for myself because I've worked and I've not worked, um,|sd
B|that it makes it, uh, sometimes it makes life more difficult.|sv
B|I think when the roles now are less defined, as far as, you know, what, uh, women should or should not be doing, that it, it, it could make life more difficult.|sv
B|There are more things to work out.|sv
B|I know when I was working, you know, you have all these problems with, with the child care and, and with, uh, pleasing, you know, your boss on the job,|sv
B|so you have added stresses from there|sv
B|and then you still have all the things that, um, that you need to do at home|sv
B|and that doesn't change, you know,|sv
B|just because your going out of the house for so many hours a day doesn't, uh, make those other things go away|sv
B|and the other responsibilities are still important.|sv
B|Um,|%
B|so, um, have you, have you worked outside, also and, um, feel that, it, that,|qy
B|well, how do you feel, as far as, uh,|qo
B|what would be a happy medium|qw
B|or, or what would you like to see?|qo
A|I would like, uh,|sv
A|yes,|ny
A|I have worked outside of the home|sd
A|and, I was in one of those safe occupations.|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|I was a school teacher,|sd
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|and we had one child when I taught for my two year career.|sd
B|Uh-huh|b
A|Uh, we,|%
A|uh, then I stopped teaching after my husband's business was established,|sd
A|and we had two children|sd
A|and I stayed home with those children, and raised those children|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|and now that my husband has retired, I am back substitute teaching,|sd
B|Yes.|b
A|which if anyone has ever been involved in that, some days it's fun|sv
A|and some days you wonder why you're even bothering,|sv
B|Right|b
A|because your fighting for your life.|sv
B|But,|%
B|yeah.|b
A|But, I am a fighter|sd
A|and I've always been a disciplinarian.|sd
A|Uh, I'm, I'm not real sure that the young girls of today are being forced into the job market as many of them imply.|sv
A|I think they're going in by choice.|sv
B|Oh, I think so.|aa
B|Yes.|aa
A|Yes.|b^m
A|And, and I have no problem with that,|sv
A|but I think the male needs to be the dominant person.|sv
A|And I think too many of the young professional wives in our small town of five thousand, uh, are not letting that happen.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They are very aggressive.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
A|They're, uh, they almost have what I would call a killer killer bee instinct.|sv
B|Yeah.|b
A|And they have to be in charge.|sv
A|And, and I I think they lose a lot by what I call neutering their husbands.|sv
B|Uh-huh.|b
B|Children Well, what do you think, ater running|qw
B|though, um, um,|%
B|I don't know.|h
B|I,|%
B|the, the one problem I guess I have,|sv
B|and maybe what so many women, younger women now are choosing to go outside is,|sv
B|I feel that in general, in this society, that being at home is not looked upon as, um, a job in itself.|sv
B|Whereas, you know, you hear a lot of women that are home saying that it is a job in itself,|sd
B|but I know when I was working,|sd
B|and I was an engineer so I was always with men,|sd
B|uh, and they were single, many of them,|sd
B|and I tried to explain to them, well, my day doesn't end when I leave at,|sd
B|I used to leave at three, I keep going to eleven at night|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|and they had, they used to look down on women that were home,|sd
B|they'd say, oh, I bet you go home and,|sd
B|you know, at least you get out of here at three|^q
B|and you can go home and put your feet up and watch soap operas,|^q
A|Oh, sure <laughter>.|b
B|and I used to be infuriated,|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|because they really had no idea what was involved once I got home.|sd
B|Now taking care of them, running them everywhere, helping with homework, the bath, the whole, you know, everything.|sd
B|Um, and I think that one reason that so many younger women feel compelled to go into a profession is that they feel that if they stay home they are not respected, and that being home is not a respectable, uh, position in society.|sv
A|Huh.|b
B|And, there's a lot of truth to that|sv
B|and I don't know how you feel.|sd
B|I don't know how you felt when you were home and what kind of feedback you got,|sd
B|but I can see with the younger men that they definitely are looking down upon women that are home.|sv
B|And yet by the same token, I think some of it is jealousy,|sv
B|you, you,|%
B|once in a while, you hear them say things like, I wish I had the choice, you know.|sd
A|Uh-huh.|b
B|I wish I was the one,|^q
B|I would stay home with my kids if my wife would go out and support us,|^q
