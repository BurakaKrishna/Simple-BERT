fe004|getting ahead of myself.|S|s|df
mn015|so|F|fg|fg
mn015|um for those who don't know|D|fh|fh
mn015|everyone knows me.|S|s|s
mn015|this is great.|S|s|ba

me045|hi.|S|s|s
mn015|and um they're engaged in in various activities some of which you will hear about today.|S|fh|fh
mn015|ami is um our counselor and spiritual guidance.|S|s|rt
mn015|and um also interested in problems concerning reference of the more complex type.|S|s|rt
me045|oh wow.|S|s|ba
mn036|well|D|%|%
mn015|and um he sits in as a interested participant and helper.|S|s|s
mn015|is that a good characterization?|Q|qy|rt
mn036|that's pretty good i think.|S|s|na
mn015|i don't know.|S|s|no
mn036|yeah.|S|s|aa
mn036|thanks.|S|s|ft
mn015|okay.|S|s|bk
mn015|keith is not technically one of us yet.|S|s|s
me045|not yet.|S|s|bk
mn015|ha ha.|S|s|s

mn015|officially i guess he will be joining us in the summer.|S|s|bu
me045|yes.|S|s|aa
mn015|and um hopefully it is by by means of keith that we will be able to get a a better formal and a better semantic um idea of what a construction is.|S|fh|fh
mn015|and um how we can make it work for us.|S|s|rt
mn015|additionally his interest um surpasses um english.|S|s|s
mn015|because it also entails german.|S|s|s
mn015|an extra capability of speaking and writing and understanding and reading that language.|S|s|s
mn015|and um is there anyone who doesn't know nancy?|Q|fh|fh
mn015|do you do you know nancy?|Q|qy|rt

fe046|officially.|S|s|m
fe046|yeah.|S|s|aa
mn015|officially.|S|s|bk
mn015|but in reality already um much much longer.|S|s|s
mn015|and um um next to some some more or less bureaucratic uh stuff with the the data collection she's also the wizard in the data collection.|S|s|s
fe004|of oz.|S|s|2
mn015|um|F|fh|fh
fe046|it's very exciting.|S|s|ba
mn015|we're sticking with the term wizard.|S|s|s
fe046|yes.|S|s|bk
fe046|yes.|D|b|b
mn015|okay.|B|b|b
mn015|and um|F|fh|fh

me003|wizardette.|S|s|cs
me045|wizard.|S|s|bc
me012|wizardess.|S|s|cs
mn015|sorceress i think.|S|s|cs
fe004|okay.|S|s|bk
fe046|wizard.|S|s|bk
mn015|wizard.|S|s|bk
fe004|okay.|S|s|bk
mn015|uh by by popular vote.|S|s|s
mn015|um|F|fh|fh
fe004|didn't take a vote.|S|s|nd
fe004|okay.|S|s|bd
mn015|okay um why don't we get started on that subject anyways?|Q|fg|fg
mn015|um so we're about to collect data.|S|fh|fh
mn015|and um the uh the following things have happened since we last met.|S|s|s
mn015|when will we three meet again?|Q|qw|rt
mn015|and um|F|fh|fh
fe004|more than three of us.|S|s|bc
mn015|what happened is that um a there was some confusion between you and jerry with the that leading to your talking to catherine snow.|S|s|rt
mn015|and he was uh he he agreed completely that something confusing happened.|S|s|s
mn015|um his idea was to get sort of the the lists of mayors of the department.|S|s|s
mn015|the students.|S|s|s
mn015|it it's exactly how you interpreted it.|S|s|s
me045|the list of majors in the department?|Q|qy|bu
mn015|sort of|D|%|%
fe046|majors?|Q|qy|bc
mn015|majors majors.|S|s|aa
fe046|majors?|Q|qy|d
fe046|okay mayor.|S|s|s
mn015|mayors.|S|s|bk
fe046|something i don't know about these.|S|s|s
mn015|majors.|S|s|bsc
fe004|the department has many mayors.|S|s|j
mn015|majors.|S|s|s
fe046|okay.|S|s|bk
mn015|and um just sending the the little write up that we did on to those email lists.|S|s|s
fe046|okay.|S|s|bk
fe046|yeah yeah yeah.|S|s|bk
fe046|but|D|%|%
fe046|yeah.|S|s|bk
mn015|uh|F|fh|fh
fe046|so it was really carol snow who was confused not me and not jerry.|S|s|s
mn015|yep yep yep.|S|s|aa
mn015|okay.|S|s|bk
mn015|so|F|fh|fh
fe046|that's good.|S|s|ba
mn015|so that is uh|D|s|s
fe046|so i should still do that?|Q|qy|bu
mn015|yep.|S|s|aa
fe046|okay.|S|s|bk
fe046|and using the thing that you wrote up.|S|s|bu
mn015|and|D|%|%
mn015|yep.|S|s|aa
fe046|okay.|S|s|bk
mn015|wonderful.|S|s|ba
mn015|and um we have a little description of asking subjects to contact fey for you know recruiting them for our thing.|S|s|s
mn015|and um there was some confusion as to the consent form which is basically that that what what you just signed.|S|fh|fh
fe004|right.|B|b|b
mn015|and since we have one already um|D|s|s
fe004|did jerry talk to you about maybe using our class?|Q|qy|rt
fe004|the students in the undergrad class that he's teaching?|Q|qy|qy
mn015|um well he said um we definitely yes.|S|fh|fh
mn015|however there is always more people in a in a uh in a department than are just taking his class or anybody else's class at the moment.|S|s|s
fe004|yeah.|B|b|b
mn015|and one should sort of reach out and try and get them all.|S|s|s
fe004|okay but i guess it's that um people in his class cover a different set.|S|s|bk
fe004|so|F|fh|fh
fe004|than the|D|s|s
fe004|is the cogsci department that you were talking about?|Q|qy|rt
fe046|i guess.|S|s|am
fe004|uh reaching out to.|S|s|e
fe046|see|D|%|%
fe004|because we have you know people from other areas.|S|s|df
fe046|that's what i suggested to him that people like like jerry and george and et cetera just|D|s|s
mn015|yeah.|B|b|b
fe004|advertise in their classes as well.|S|s|2
fe046|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe046|or even i could you know i could do the actual|D|s|cs
fe004|because i mean i i know how to contact our students.|S|s|s
mn015|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe046|that's generally the way it's done.|S|s|df
fe004|so if there's something that you're sending out you can also um send me a copy.|S|s|s
mn015|yeah.|B|b|b
fe004|me or bhaskara could either of us could post it to|D|s|cs
fe004|uh|F|fh|fh
fe004|is it|D|%|%
fe004|if it's a general solicitation that you know is just contact you then we can totally post it to the news group.|S|s|s
fe046|a mailing list.|S|s|2
mn015|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe046|yeah.|B|b|b
mn015|yeah.|B|b|b
fe004|so|F|fh|fh
mn015|do it.|S|s|co
fe046|that's|D|%|%
mn015|yeah.|B|b|b
fe004|okay.|S|s|bk
fe004|so you'll send it?|Q|qy|rt
fe004|or something?|Q|qr|bu
fe004|so|F|fh|fh
mn015|as a matter of fact if you|D|s|s
fe046|i can send it.|S|s|cc
fe046|i'll send it.|S|s|cc
fe004|you can send it to me.|S|s|s
mn015|if|D|%|%
fe004|okay.|S|s|bk
fe046|yeah.|B|b|b
mn015|now|D|s|s
fe004|don't worry.|S|s|co
fe004|we this doesn't concern you anymore robert.|S|s|df
fe004|it's fine.|S|s|ba
mn015|how however i suggest that if you if you look at your email carefully you may think you may find that you already have it.|S|s|cs
fe004|oops!|S|s|fe
fe004|already?|Q|qy|br
fe004|really?|Q|qh|qh
fe004|oops!|S|s|fe
mn015|maybe.|S|s|am
mn015|okay.|S|s|bk
fe004|i don't remember getting anything.|S|s|no
mn015|we'll see.|S|s|cc
mn015|anyhow.|S|s|t
mn015|um the uh|F|fh|fh
mn015|yeah not only cogsci.|S|fg|fg
mn015|also we will talk about linguistics and of course computer science.|S|s|s
fe004|uhhuh.|S|s|bk
mn015|um and then secondly we had you may remember um the problem with the re phrasing.|S|fg|fg
mn015|that subject always rephrase sort of the task that uh we gave them.|S|s|rt
me003|right.|B|b|b
mn015|and so we had a meeting on friday talking about how to avoid that.|S|s|rt
mn015|and it proved finally fruitful in the sense that we came up with a new scenario for how to get the the subject to really have intentions.|S|s|s
mn015|and sort of to act upon those.|S|s|rt
mn015|and um|F|fh|fh
mn015|there the idea is now that next actually we we need to hire one more person to actually do that job.|S|s|s
mn015|because it it's getting more complicated.|S|s|df
mn015|so if you know anyone interested in in what i'm about to describe tell that person to to write a mail to me or jerry soon.|S|s|co
mn015|fast.|S|s|e
mn015|um the idea now is to sort of come up with a high level of sort of abstract tasks.|S|fh|fh
mn015|go shopping.|S|s|s
mn015|um take in uh a batch of art.|S|s|s
mn015|um|F|fh|fh
mn015|visit|D|%|%
mn015|do some sightseeing.|S|s|s
mn015|blah blah blah blah blah.|S|s|s
mn015|sort of analogous to what fey has started in in in compiling compiling here.|S|s|rt
mn015|and already she has already gone to the trouble of of anchoring it with specific um um entities and real world places you will find in heidelberg.|S|s|rt
mn015|and um|F|fh|fh
mn015|so out of these these high level categories the subject can pick a couple.|S|s|rt
mn015|such as if if there is a uh a category in emptying your roll of film the person can then decide okay i want to do that at this place.|S|s|s
mn015|sort of make up their own itinerary and and tasks.|S|s|s
mn015|and the person is not allowed to take sort of this high level category list with them.|S|s|s
mn015|but uh|F|fh|fh
mn015|the person is able to take notes on a map that we will give him and the map will be a tourist's sort of schematic representation with with symbols for the objects.|S|s|s
mn015|and so the person can maybe make a mental note that uh yeah i wanted to go shopping here.|S|s|cs
mn015|and i wanted to maybe take a picture of that.|S|s|s
mn015|and maybe um eat here.|S|s|s
mn015|and then goes in and solves the task with the system.|S|s|s
mn015|i e fey.|S|s|s
mn015|and um|F|fh|fh
mn015|and we're going to try out that.|S|s|s
mn015|any questions?|Q|qy|rt
fe004|so um you'll have those say somewhere what their intention was?|Q|fg|fg
fe004|so you still have the the nice thing about having data where you know what the actual intention was.|S|s|bu
mn015|uhhuh yeah.|S|s|aa
fe004|but they will um|D|s|s
fe004|there's nothing that says you know these are the things you want to do .|S|s|s
fe004|so they'll say well these are the things i want to do.|S|s|s
fe004|and|F|fh|fh
fe004|right.|B|b|b
fe004|so they'll have a little bit more natural interaction.|S|s|bu
fe004|okay.|S|s|bk
mn015|hopefully.|S|s|ba
fe004|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me012|so they'll be given this map which means that they won't have to like ask the system for for like high level information about where things are?|Q|qy|bu
mn015|yeah it's a schematic tourist map.|S|s|aa
mn015|so it'll be uh it'll still require the that information.|S|s|s
mn015|and|D|%|%
fe004|it it doesn't have like streets on it that would allow them to figure out their way|D|qy|bu
mn015|not not not really the street network.|S|s|nd
fe004|okay.|S|s|bk
mn015|nuh.|B|b|b
me045|so you're just saying like what part of town the things are in or whatever?|Q|qy|bu
mn015|yeah|D|s|aa
mn015|and um|F|fh|fh
mn015|the map is more a means for them to have the buildings and their names.|S|s|rt
mn015|and maybe some major streets and their names.|S|s|rt
fe004|uhhuh.|B|b|b
mn015|and we want to maybe ask them if you have get it sort of isolated street.|S|s|s
mn015|the the whatever.|S|s|s
mn015|river street.|S|s|s
mn015|and they know that they have decided that yes that's where they want to do this kind of action um that they have it with them and they can actually read them.|S|s|s
mn015|or sort of have the label for the object.|S|s|s
mn015|because it's too hard to memorize all these strange german names.|S|s|df
mn015|and then we're going to have another we're going to have another trial run.|S|s|s
mn015|i e the first with that new setup tomorrow at two.|S|s|rt
mn015|and we have a real interesting subject which is ron kay.|S|s|rt
mn015|for who those who know him he's the founder of i c i.|S|s|s
mn015|so he'll he's around seventy years old or something.|S|s|s
fe004|i didn't know he was the founder.|S|s|no
fe004|that's|D|%|%
fe004|okay.|S|s|bk
mn015|and he also approached me and he offered to help um our project.|S|s|s
mn015|and he was more thinking about some high level thinking tasks.|S|s|s
mn015|and i said sure we need help.|S|s|s
mn015|you can come in as a subject.|S|s|s
mn015|and he said okay.|S|s|s
mn015|so that's what's going to happen tomorrow.|S|s|s
fe004|using this new new um plan.|S|s|bu
mn015|data.|S|s|s
mn015|new new set up.|S|s|2
fe004|okay.|S|s|bk
mn015|yeah.|B|b|b
mn015|which i'll hopefully sort of scrape together|D|s|s
mn015|but thanks to fey we already have sort of a nice blueprint and i can work with that.|S|s|s
mn015|questions?|Q|qo|qo
mn015|comments on that?|Q|qo|qo
mn015|if not we can move on.|S|s|s
mn015|no?|Q|qy|d
mn015|no more questions?|Q|qy|d
fe004|so what's the this is what you made fey?|Q|qw|t3
me045|i'm not sure i totally understand this.|S|s|s
me045|but|D|%|%
mn015|huh?|Q|qw|br
me045|i'm not sure i totally understand everything that's being talked about.|S|s|s
fe004|like so so it's just based on like the materials you had about heidelberg?|Q|qy|bu
me045|but i i imagine i'll just catch on.|S|s|s
mn015|um are you familiar with with the with the very rough setup of the data?|Q|qy|rt
fe046|based on the web site.|S|s|s
fe046|yeah at the|D|%|%
fe004|oh okay.|S|s|bk
fe004|there's a web site.|S|s|s
fe004|and then you could like um figure out what the|D|s|s
mn015|experiment.|S|s|e
fe046|right.|B|b|b
me045|uh this is where they're supposed to|D|h|h
fe046|it's a tourist information web site.|S|s|t3
fe004|okay.|S|s|bk
fe046|so|F|fh|fh
fe004|okay.|S|s|bk
mn015|talk to a machine and it breaks down and then the human comes on.|S|s|2
me045|yeah.|S|s|aa
me045|yeah.|B|b|b
mn015|the question is just sort of how do we get the tasks in their head that they have an intention of doing something and have a need to ask the system for something without giving them sort of a clear wording or phrasing of the task.|S|s|s
me045|okay.|B|b|b
me045|okay.|B|b|b
me045|okay.|B|b|b
me045|okay.|B|b|b
mn015|because what will happen then is that people repeat repeat or as much as they can of that phrasing.|S|s|s
fe004|huh.|B|b|b
fe004|um are you worried about being able to identify|D|fg|fg
me045|okay.|B|b|b
fe004|um|F|fh|fh
fe004|the the goals that we've you guys have been talking about are this these you know identifying which of three modes um their question uh concerns.|S|s|s
mn015|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe004|so it's like the enter versus view|D|s|s
mn015|yeah we we we will sort of get a protocol of the prior interaction.|S|s|bk
fe004|uhhuh.|B|b|b
mn015|right?|Q|qy|d
mn015|that's where the instructor the person we are going to hire um and the subjects sit down together with these high level things.|S|s|s
fe004|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe004|uhhuh.|B|b|b
mn015|and so|D|%|%
mn015|the first question for the subject is so these are things you know we thought a tourist can do.|S|s|s
mn015|is there anything that interests you?|Q|qy|qy
fe004|uhhuh.|B|b|b
mn015|and the person can say yeah sure|D|s|s
mn015|this is something i would do.|S|s|s
mn015|i would go shopping.|S|s|s
mn015|yeah?|Q|qy|d
fe004|uhhuh.|B|b|b
mn015|and then we can sort of this instructor can say well uh then you you may want to find out how to get over here.|S|s|s
mn015|because this is where the shopping district is.|S|s|s
fe004|so the interaction beforehand will give them hints about how specific or how whatever though the kinds of questions that are going to ask during the actual session?|Q|qy|bu
mn015|no.|S|s|ar
mn015|just sort of okay what what what would you like to buy.|S|s|s
mn015|and then um okay there you want to buy a whatever cuckoos clocks.|S|s|s
fe004|yeah.|B|b|b
mn015|okay and there is a store there.|S|s|s
me045|uhhuh.|B|b|b
mn015|so the task then for that person is finding out how to get there.|S|s|s
fe004|uhhuh.|B|b|b
mn015|right?|Q|qy|d
mn015|that's sort of what's left.|S|s|s
fe004|uhhuh.|B|b|b
mn015|and we know that the intention is to enter because we know that the person wants to buy a cuckoos clock.|S|s|s
fe004|okay that's what i mean.|S|s|bk
fe004|so like those tasks are all going to be um unambiguous about which of the three modes.|S|s|bu
mn015|hopefully.|S|s|na
fe004|right okay.|S|s|bk
fe004|so|F|fh|fh
mn036|well so the idea is to try to get the actual phrasing that they might use and try to interfere as little as possible with their choice of words.|S|s|bu
mn015|hopefully.|S|s|na
fe004|that they'll be here?|Q|qy|d
mn015|yes in a sense that's exactly the the the idea.|S|s|aa
mn036|uh uh|F|fh|fh
mn015|which is never possible in a in a in a lab situation.|S|s|s
mn036|well the one experiment that that that i've read somewhere it was they used pictures.|S|s|ng
mn015|nuh?|Q|qy|d
mn015|yep.|S|s|bk
me045|uhhuh.|B|b|b
mn036|so to to uh actually um uh specify the the tasks.|S|s|s
mn036|uh but you know|D|s|s
mn015|yeah.|B|b|b
mn015|we had exactly that on our list of possible things.|S|s|rt
mn015|so we uh i even made a sort of a silly thing how that could work how you control you are here.|S|s|s
mn015|you you want to know how to get someplace.|S|s|s
mn015|and this is the place.|S|s|s
mn015|and it's a museum.|S|s|s
mn015|and you want to do|D|s|s
mn015|and and and there's a person looking at pictures.|S|s|s
mn015|so you know this is exactly getting someplace with the intention of entering and looking at pictures.|S|s|s
mn036|right.|B|b|b
mn015|however not only was the common census were among all participants of friday's meeting was it's going to be very laborious to to make these drawings for each different things.|S|s|rt
mn015|all the different actions if at all possible.|S|s|s
mn036|right.|B|b|b
mn015|and also people will get caught up in the pictures.|S|s|s
mn015|so all of a sudden we'll get descriptions of pictures in there.|S|s|s
mn036|right.|B|b|b
mn015|and people talking about pictures and pictorial representations.|S|s|s
