me003|okay.|B|b|b
me003|so let's see.|S|s|t1
me003|which one of these buttons will do this for me?|Q|qw|t1
me003|aha!|S|s|fe
me003|okay.|B|b|b
me012|should you go back to the first one?|Q|qy|rt
me003|do i want to go back to the first one?|Q|qy|m
me012|well|D|%|%
me003|okay.|S|s|aa
fe004|i'm sorry i|D|s|fa
me012|well i mean just to|D|s|bd
me003|okay.|S|s|bk
me003|introduce.|S|s|co
fe004|okay.|S|s|bk
me012|yeah um well the search for the middle layer.|S|s|bk
me012|it's basically uh talks about uh it just refers to the fact that uh one of main things we had to do was to decide what the intermediate sort of nodes were.|S|s|s
fe004|i can read!|S|s|fe
fe004|i'm kidding.|S|s|bd
fe004|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me012|you know because|D|s|s
mn015|but if you really want to find out what it's about you have to click on the little light bulb.|S|s|s
me003|although i've i've never i don't know what the light bulb is for.|S|s|no
me003|i didn't install that into my powerpoint presentation.|S|s|s
mn015|it opens the assistant that tells you that the font type is too small.|S|s|s
me003|uh.|S|s|bk
mn015|do you want to try?|Q|qy|rt
fe004|ach|D|%|%
me003|i'd prefer not to.|S|s|nd
mn015|okay.|S|s|bk
mn015|continue.|S|s|co
fe004|it's a needless good idea.|S|s|s
fe004|is that the idea?|Q|qy|g
mn015|why are you doing this in this mode and not in the presentation mode?|Q|qw|qw
fe004|okay.|S|s|bk
me003|because i'm going to switch to the javabayes program.|S|s|rt
mn015|oh okay.|S|s|bk
mn015|of course.|S|s|bk
mn015|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me003|and then if i do that it'll mess everything up.|S|s|s
fe004|i was wondering.|S|s|s
me003|is that okay?|Q|qy|rt
fe004|yeah it's okay.|S|s|aa
mn015|sure.|B|b|b
me012|can you maximize the window?|Q|qy|rt
fe004|proceed.|S|s|co
me003|you want me to|D|qy|d
me003|wait what do you want me to do?|Q|qw|br
me012|can you maximize the window so all that stuff on the side isn't doesn't appear?|Q|qy|qy
mn015|no it's okay.|S|s|ar
mn015|it's it'll work.|S|s|s
me003|well i can do that.|S|s|aap
me003|but then i have to end the presentation in the middle so i can go back to open up javabayes.|S|s|ng
me012|okay fine.|S|s|bk
me003|here let's see if i can|D|s|s
me012|all right.|S|s|bk
fe004|very nice.|S|s|ba
me003|is that better?|Q|qy|rt
me012|yeah.|S|s|aa
me003|okay.|S|s|bk
me003|uh i'll also get rid of this click to add notes.|S|s|cc
me003|okay.|B|b|b
fe004|perfect.|S|s|ba
me003|so then the features we decided or we decided we were talked about.|S|s|s
me003|right?|Q|qy|d
me003|uh the the prosody the discourse verb choice.|S|s|s
me003|you know we had a list of things like to go and to visit and what not.|S|s|s
me003|the landmark-iness of uh|D|s|s
me003|i knew you'd like that.|S|s|s
fe004|nice coinage.|S|s|ba
me003|thank you.|S|s|ft
me003|uh of a of a building.|S|s|s
me003|whether the|D|s|s
me003|and this we actually have a separate feature.|S|s|s
me003|but i decided to put it on the same line for space.|S|s|s
me003|nice walls which we can look up.|S|s|s
me003|because i mean if you're going to get real close to a building in the tango mode|D|s|s
me003|right?|Q|qy|d
me003|there's got to be a reason for it.|S|s|s
me003|and it's either because you're in route to something else or you want to look at the walls.|S|s|s
me003|the context which in this case we've limited to business person tourist or unknown.|S|s|s
me003|the time of day.|S|s|s
me003|and open to suggestions isn't actually a feature.|S|s|s
me003|it's we are open to suggestions.|S|s|s
fe004|right.|S|s|bk
fe004|can i just ask the nice walls part of it is that uh in this particular domain|D|qy|qy
fe004|you said be it could be on two different lines.|S|s|df
fe004|but are you saying that in this particular domain it happens the that landmark-iness is correlated with|D|qy|qy
me012|no.|S|s|ar
me003|oh|D|%|%
me012|we have a separate|D|s|nd
me003|they're separate things.|S|s|s
fe004|their being nice|D|s|s
me012|feature.|S|s|bsc
fe004|okay.|S|s|bk
me003|yeah.|B|b|b
me003|i either could put nice walls on its own line or open to suggestions off the slide.|S|s|s
fe004|and and|D|%|%
me012|like you could have a|D|s|s
fe004|by nice you mean|D|qy|d
me012|you like you could have a post office with uh you know nice murals or something.|S|s|s
me003|right.|S|s|aa
fe004|okay.|S|s|bk
me003|or one time i was at this|D|s|s
fe004|so nice walls is a stand in for like architecturally it uh significant.|S|s|bu
me012|architecturally appealing from the outside.|S|s|na
fe004|or something like that.|S|s|s
me003|but see the thing is if it's|D|s|nd
fe004|okay.|S|s|bk
me003|yeah but if it's architecturally significant you might be able to see it from|D|fg|fg
me003|like you might be able to vista it.|S|s|s
me003|right?|Q|qy|d
mn015|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me003|and be able to|D|s|s
fe004|uhhuh.|B|b|b
mn015|appreciate it.|S|s|2
me003|yeah.|S|s|aa
me003|versus like|D|s|s
me003|i was at this place in europe where they had little carvings of like dead people on the walls or something.|S|s|rt
fe004|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me003|i don't remember|D|s|no
fe004|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me003|it was a long time ago.|S|s|s
fe004|there's a lot of those.|S|s|s
me003|but if you looked at it real close you could see the the intricacy of the of the walls.|S|s|s
fe004|okay.|S|s|bk
fe004|so that count as counts as a nice wall.|S|s|bu
me003|right.|S|s|aa
fe004|the|D|%|%
fe004|okay.|S|s|bk
mn015|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe004|right.|B|b|b
fe004|something you want to inspect at close range because it's interesting.|S|s|bu
mn015|the|D|%|%
me003|exactly.|S|s|aa
fe004|okay.|S|s|bk
mn015|huh.|B|b|b
me003|robert?|Q|qy|d
mn015|well there there is a term that's often used.|S|s|s
mn015|that's saliency or the salience of an object.|S|s|rt
mn015|and i was just wondering whether that's the same as what you describe as landmark-iness.|S|s|s
mn015|but it's really not.|S|s|s
mn015|i mean an object can be very salient.|S|s|s
fe004|huh.|B|b|b
mn015|but not a landmark at all.|S|s|2
fe004|not a landmark at all.|S|s|m
fe004|there's landmark for um touristic reasons and landmark for|D|s|s
fe004|i don't know.|S|s|no
fe004|navigational reasons or something.|S|s|s
me003|right.|B|b|b
mn015|yep.|B|b|b
me012|yeah.|B|b|b
me012|we meant uh touristic reasons.|S|s|s
me003|yeah.|B|b|b
fe004|okay.|S|s|bk
mn015|huh.|B|b|b
me003|right.|B|b|b
fe004|okay.|B|b|b
fe004|but you can imagine maybe wanting the both kinds of things there for different um goals.|S|s|bu
mn015|huh.|B|b|b
me012|yeah.|B|b|b
fe004|right?|Q|qy|d
me003|right.|S|s|aa
me003|but|D|s|arp
me003|yeah.|B|b|b
me003|touristy landmarks also happen to be|D|s|s
me003|wouldn't couldn't they also be|D|qy|qy
me003|they're not exclusive groups.|S|s|bu
me003|are they?|Q|qy|g
me003|like non tourist y landmarks and|D|s|s
mn015|or it can be|D|s|s
fe004|they're not mutually exclusive?|Q|qy|m
me003|direct navigational|D|s|s
me003|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe004|right.|S|s|aa
me003|okay.|S|s|bk
fe004|right.|S|s|aa
fe004|definitely.|S|s|aa
me003|okay so our initial idea was not very satisfying because uh our initial idea was basically all the features pointing to the output node.|S|fg|fg
me003|uh|F|fh|fh
fe004|so a big flat structure.|S|s|bu
fe004|right?|Q|qy|d
me003|right.|S|s|aa
me012|yep.|S|s|aa
me003|and uh so we|D|s|s
me003|reasons being you know it'd be a pain to set up all the probabilities for that.|S|s|s
me003|if we moved onto the next step and did learning of some sort uh according bhaskara we'd be handicapped.|S|s|s
me003|i don't know belief nets very well.|S|s|no
me012|well usually i mean you know n|D|s|s
me012|if you have n features then it's two to the n or exponential in n.|S|s|s
me003|and they wouldn't look pretty.|S|s|2
me003|so|D|s|s
me012|yeah.|S|s|aa
me012|they'd all be like pointing to the one node.|S|s|s
mn015|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me003|uh|F|fh|fh
me003|so then our next idea was to add a middle layer.|S|s|s
me003|right?|Q|qy|d
me003|so the thinking behind that was we have the features that we've drawn from the communication of some like the someone|D|s|s
me003|the person at the screen is trying to communicate some abstract idea.|S|s|s
me003|like i'm the the abstract idea being i am a tourist.|S|s|s
me003|i want to go to this place.|S|s|s
me003|right?|Q|qy|d
me003|so we're going to set up features along the lines of where they want to go.|S|s|s
me003|and what they've said previously and whatnot.|S|s|s
me003|and then we have the means that they should use.|S|s|s
me003|right?|Q|qy|d
me003|but the middle thing we were thinking along the lines of maybe trying to figure out like the concept of whether they're a tourist or whether they're running an errand or something like that.|S|s|s
me003|along those lines.|S|s|s
me003|or|D|s|s
me003|yes we things we couldn't extract the from the data the hidden variables.|S|s|aa
me003|yes.|S|s|aa
me003|good.|S|s|ba
me003|so then the hidden variables hair variables we came up with were whether someone was on a tour running an errand or whether they were in a hurry.|S|s|s
me003|because we were thinking uh if they were in a hurry there'd be less likely to like or|D|s|s
me012|want to do vista.|S|s|2
me012|right?|Q|qy|d
me012|because if you want to view things you wouldn't be in a hurry.|S|s|df
me003|right.|S|s|aa
me003|or they might be more likely to be using the place that they want to go to as a like a navigational point to go to another place.|S|s|s
fe004|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me003|whether the destination was their final destination.|S|s|s
me003|whether the destination was closed.|S|s|s
me003|those are all|D|s|s
me003|and then let's look at the belief net okay.|S|s|tc
me003|so that means that i should switch to the other program.|S|s|t1
me003|um right now it's still kind of in a toy version of it.|S|s|s
me003|because we didn't know the probabilities of or|D|s|s
me003|well i'll talk about it when i get the picture up.|S|s|s
mn015|no one knows it.|S|s|s
me003|okay.|F|h|h
me003|so this right what we|D|s|s
me003|let's see.|S|s|t1
me003|what happens if i maximize this?|Q|qw|t1
me003|there we go.|S|s|t1
me003|but uh|D|s|s
me003|so the mode basically has three different outputs.|S|s|s
me003|the probability whether the probability of a vista tango or enter|D|s|s
me003|um the context we simplified.|S|h|h
me003|basically it's just the businessman the tourist unknown.|S|s|s
me003|verb used is actually personally amusing.|S|s|s
me003|mainly because it's it's just whether the verb is a tango verb an enter verb or a vista verb.|S|s|s
me012|yeah.|F|fg|fg
me012|that one needs a lot of|D|s|s
fe004|and are those mutually exclusive sets?|Q|qy|qy
me012|not at all.|S|s|ar
me012|that's that that needs a lot of work.|S|s|r
me003|no.|S|s|ar
fe004|right.|S|s|bk
fe004|got it.|S|s|bk
me012|but uh that would've made the probably significantly be more complicated to enter.|S|s|s
fe004|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe004|yeah.|B|b|b
me012|so we decided that for the purposes of this it'd be simpler to just have three verbs.|S|s|rt
fe004|simple.|S|s|s
me003|yeah.|B|b|b
fe004|stab at it.|S|s|s
fe004|yep.|B|b|b
me003|right.|B|b|b
me003|um|F|fg|fg
me003|why don't you mention things about this bhaskara?|Q|qh|cs
me003|that i am not that are not coming to my mind right now.|S|s|s
me012|okay so yeah so note the four nodes down there the sort of the things that are not directly extracted.|S|s|bk
me012|actually the five things.|S|s|bsc
me012|the closed is also not directly extracted i guess.|S|s|s
me012|from the uh|D|s|s
me003|well it's|D|%|%
fe004|from the utterance?|Q|qy|2
me012|huh.|B|b|b
me012|actually no.|S|s|ar
me003|it's it sort of is.|S|s|nd
me012|wait.|S|s|co
me012|it is.|S|s|aa
me003|because it's because have the the time of day.|S|s|df
me012|okay closed sort of is.|S|s|s
me003|and the close|D|s|s
me003|it just had the uh and what time it closed.|S|s|s
me012|right.|S|s|bk
me012|so|D|%|%
me012|right.|F|fg|fg
me012|but the other ones the final destination the whether they're doing business whether they're in a hurry and whether they're tourists.|S|s|s
me012|that kind of thing is all uh sort of you know probabilistically depends on the other things.|S|s|s
fe004|inferred from the other ones?|Q|qy|2
me012|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe004|okay.|B|b|b
me012|and the mode you know depends on all those things only.|S|s|s
me003|yeah the the actual parse is somewhere up around in here.|S|s|s
me012|yeah.|F|fg|fg
me012|so we haven't uh managed|D|s|s
me012|like we don't have nodes for discourse and parse.|S|s|s
me012|although like in some sense they are parts of this belief net.|S|s|s
fe004|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me012|but uh the idea is that we just extract those features from them so we don't actually have a node for the entire parse.|S|s|s
fe004|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me003|right.|B|b|b
me012|because we'd never do inference on it anyway.|S|s|s
me012|so|F|fh|fh
fe004|so some of the the top row of things|D|s|s
fe004|what's what's disc admission fee?|Q|qw|qw
me012|whether they discuss the admission fees.|S|s|s
me012|so we looked at the data.|S|s|s
fe004|oh.|S|s|bk
me012|and in a lot of data people were saying things like can i get to this place.|S|s|s
me012|what is the admission fee.|S|s|s
me012|so that's like a huge uh clue that they're trying to enter the place rather than uh to tango or vista.|S|s|s
fe004|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me003|right.|B|b|b
fe004|okay.|B|b|b
me012|so|F|fg|fg
fe004|i see.|S|s|bk
me003|there were there'd be other things besides just the admission fee.|S|s|s
me003|but you know we didn't have|D|s|s
fe004|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me012|that was like our example.|S|s|s
me003|that was the initial one that we found.|S|s|s
mn015|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe004|okay.|S|s|bk
fe004|so there are certain cues that are very strong either lexical or topic based um concept cues.|S|s|bu
me003|from the discourse that|D|s|2
me003|yeah.|S|s|aa
fe004|for one of those.|S|s|s
fe004|and then in that second row or whatever that row of time of day through that so all of those some of them come from the utterance.|S|s|bu
fe004|and some of them are sort of either world knowledge or situational things.|S|s|bu
fe004|right?|Q|qy|d
fe004|so that you have no distinction between those and|D|s|bu
me003|right.|S|s|aa
fe004|okay.|S|s|bk
me003|one uh uh um|F|fg|fg
me003|anything else you want to say bhaskara?|Q|qo|rt
me012|um|F|h|h
fe004|unmark time of day?|D|qy|qy
me012|yeah.|S|s|aa
me012|i i mean|D|s|s
me003|one thing uh|D|s|s
mn015|yeah.|F|fg|fg
mn015|they're they're are a couple of more things.|S|s|s
mn015|i mean uh i would actually suggest we go through this one more time so we we all uh agree on what what the meaning of these things is at the moment.|S|s|cs
mn015|and maybe what changes we|D|s|s
me003|yeah|D|s|aa
me003|okay.|F|fg|fg
me003|so one thing i i'm you know unsure about is how we have the uh the admission fee thing set up.|S|s|s
me003|so one thing that we were thinking was by doing the layers like this|D|s|s
me003|uh we kept um things from directly affecting the mode beyond the concept.|S|s|s
me003|but you could see perhaps the admission fee going directly to the mode pointing at enter.|S|s|s
mn015|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me003|right?|Q|qy|d
me003|versus pointing just at tourist.|S|s|rt
fe004|uhhuh.|B|b|b
fe004|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me003|okay?|Q|qy|d
me003|but we just decided to keep all the things we extracted to point at the middle and then down.|S|s|s
mn015|uhhuh.|B|b|b
mn015|why is the landmark|D|qw|rt
mn015|okay.|B|b|b
mn015|the landmark is facing to the tourists.|S|s|s
mn015|that's because we're talking about landmarks as touristic landmarks.|S|s|bu
me003|right.|S|s|aa
mn015|not as possible um|D|s|s
me012|yeah.|S|s|aa
me003|navigational landmarks.|S|s|bk
fe004|navigational cue.|S|s|2
me003|yeah.|B|b|b
mn015|navigational landmarks.|S|s|2
mn015|so|F|fh|fh
mn015|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me003|yeah.|B|b|b
mn015|then|D|s|s
me003|that would be whatever building they referred to.|S|s|s
fe004|prosody.|D|s|s
me012|right.|B|b|b
me012|so let's see.|S|s|t1
me012|the variables.|S|s|s
me012|admission fee is a binary thing.|S|s|s
mn015|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me012|time of day is like morning afternoon night.|S|s|bu
me012|is that the deal?|Q|qy|d
me003|that's how we have it currently set up.|S|s|na
me012|yeah.|B|b|b
me003|but it could be you know based upon hour.|S|s|s
mn015|yep.|D|s|aa
me012|yeah.|B|b|b
me012|yeah.|B|b|b
me003|or we could discrete it descret-ize it.|S|s|s
mn015|whatever granularity.|S|s|s
me012|yeah.|B|b|b
fe004|uhhuh.|B|b|b
mn015|uhhuh.|B|b|b
me012|yeah.|B|b|b
me012|yeah.|F|fg|fg
me012|normally context will include a huge amount of information.|S|s|s
me012|but um we are just using the particular part of the context which consists of the switch that they flick to indicate whether they're a tourist or not i guess.|S|s|rt
mn015|yep.|B|b|b
fe004|okay.|F|fg|fg
fe004|so that's given in their input.|S|s|bs
me003|right.|B|b|b
me012|so|F|fg|fg
fe004|right?|Q|qy|d
me012|right.|S|s|aa
me012|so it's not really all of context.|S|s|s
me012|similarly prosody is not all of prosody.|S|s|s
me012|but simply for our purposes whether or not they appear tense or relaxed.|S|s|s
